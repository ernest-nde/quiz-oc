# Backend
This repertory content all backend files like : 
- Server Initialization,
- App creation with Express,
- Data Structure shema : done with Moogone that is you to connect our app to this project MongoDB database,
- The use of the CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing ), which is used by default, blocks HTTP calls between different servers, thus preventing malicious requests from accessing sensitive resources (In our case localhost:3000 for the backend and localhost:4200 for the front end)
